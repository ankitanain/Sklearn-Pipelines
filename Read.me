Introduction:

Scikit-Learn is a powerful Python library for machine learning.
Provides tools for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
Installation:

Install using pip: pip install scikit-learn.
Basic Usage:

Import modules:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
Prepare your data (X and y).
Choose a model: model = RandomForestClassifier().
Split data into training and testing sets.
Train the model: model.fit(X_train, y_train).
Make predictions: y_pred = model.predict(X_test).
Evaluate the model: accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred).
Advanced Features:

Scikit-learn offers pipelines for automated preprocessing and modeling.
Supports hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for model selection.
Refer to the documentation for detailed guidance.
